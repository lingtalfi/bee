Checkboxes, when not checked, are part of the array with a value of false.

Algorithm:
------------


Flat mode: no array

- process all element which has the name attribute defined,
        and store its values in an array.

        For checkboxes:
            if the value attribute is not defined:
                    a boolean value will be returned.
            If the value attribute is defined:
                    the value will be used if checked,
                    null will be used if not checked
