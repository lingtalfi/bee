Compatibility notes
======================
2014-11-21



I'm not a big fan of coding for different browsers.
Since my favourite browser is firefox, I usually only develop using firefox, so that I can develop faster.

The obvious downside of this approach is that what I code might not work in other browsers.

Usually, I noticed that it's quite easy to make a script work for chrome.
In the case of MacGuiMenu, I had to change one function to have it okay, but not perfect, see the table below.





- Firefox (33.1): Works perfectly
- Chrome (38.0.2125.122): Works ok
            It works almost perfectly, except that for the shortcut cmd+N in specific (other shortcuts seems to work),
            chrome always takes precedence, I don't know why.
- Safari: assuming the same as chrome, not tested
- Others: not tested
