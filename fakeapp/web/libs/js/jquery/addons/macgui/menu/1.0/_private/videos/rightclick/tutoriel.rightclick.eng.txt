Tutorial: Right click
============
2014-11-21



Hi, I'm lingtalfi.
In this tutorial, we will create a contextual menu with macGuiMenu.

The final result will look like this (t).

In order to successfully complete this tutorial, you need to have a basic understanding of javascript and jquery.
I also recommend that you first watch the tutorial on topmenus, since I will be reusing concepts explained in the topmenu tutorial.



Let's start by downloading the startup file.
This file contains the basic layout, without any javascript code.
We will add javascript code as we go through this tutorial.

    We will start by adding the macGuiMenu library and its dependencies to our html page

1.

    We will now create the jZone1 variable, it will contain our screen zone.
    We can now call the createRightClickZone.

    This method takes two arguments: a zone, and a panel identifier.
    The zone is simply a jquery object, in this case we will pass the jZone1 variable.

    For the panel identifier, or uid, let's put desktop.
    Now, we can use the createStandardPanel method to create the desktop panel.
    The createStandardPanel method has been explained in the topmenus tutorial, so I won't
    talk much about it.

    Let's create some random panel.

    Before we test our code, we need to define the action when an item is executed.
    In this tutorial, we will display the uid of the executed item next to the apple
    at the bottom middle of the screen.

    We will use the executeItem method, like in the previous tutorial.

    We can now test our code (t)
    If we rightclick INSIDE the screen zone, our menu appears.
    If we rightclick OUTSIDE the screen zone, the browser contextual menu appears.

    We can check that clicking on an item triggers the corresponding action (t).

    However, if we press the ctrl+a shortcut now, it won't work,
    because we haven't tell MacGuiMenu to listen to the keyboard shortcuts now.

    So let's go back to the code and add the following two lines (t).
    Now the shortcut should work.


2.

    The last step of this tutorial will be to create a second contextual menu
    that opens when we right click the folder inside the screen (s).
    We will call the createRightClickZone method again;
    the first argument will be the jquery object representing the folder zone,
    and let's call our panel folder.

    We now need to create the panel with an uid equals to folder.


    Let's check the gui one last time (t).

    So that's it, this is the end of the second tutorial.
    I hope this was useful.

    Thanks for watching, bye.
