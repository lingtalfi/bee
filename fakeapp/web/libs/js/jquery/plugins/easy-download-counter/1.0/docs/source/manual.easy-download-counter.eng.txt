Easy download counter - clic tracker
=========================

Presentation
----------------

Easy Download counter - clic tracker (edc) is a jquery plugin that tracks
the number clicks on links (download links, or regular links).
It can also display the number of downloads for each link.
Last but not least, it comes with a simple statistic visualization interface.

Edc is very easy to setup, and even intuitive for experimented users.

The counters memorization uses the filesystem only, so that the plugin can be immediately ready to use
(we don't need to setup a database, for instance);
we simply need to ensure that the stats folder has the write permissions, see below.

In order to collect statistic for a given link, we need to assign an identifier to that link;
the number of clicks is then collected, and the data are organized in years, months and days.



Installation
--------------
The first and only thing to do for the setup is to give the write permissions to the
stats folder: easy-download-counter/1.0/service/stats.
This folder will contain all the data collected when the users click your links.
Data are collected in the form of simple text files.
If you don't have the write permissions, the plugin will not be able to memorize the number of clicks,
and hence will be useless, and you will have some errors when someone tries to click your links.

In unix systems, if your website is located in the /mysite/www folder, you can type the following command in
a terminal:


	sudo chmod -R 777 /mysite/www/easy-download-counter/1.0/service/stats


And voil√†!
That's it for the setup ;)
You can now test the jquery plugin.



Demo
------
(you should have read the installation section first)
Open the easy-download-counter/1.0/demo.php file with a web server.

On the page that shows up, you will see 2 example links with counters,
and one more link that opens the statistics visualization interface in a new tab.
In order to give you a realistic overview of the statistics visualization interface, I deliberately
added some fake data. The graphs are prettier with more data.
When you launch your website in production, you can simply delete the content of the
stats folder (easy-download-counter/1.0/service/stats),
to get rid of all the fake data.
If you inadvertently delete the stats folder itself, remember to give it write permissions.




Quickstart
--------------
(you should have read the installation section first)
Paste the following code in an html file and open it with a webserver (or adapt it for your application):


	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8"/>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"></script>
		<script src="easy-download-counter.js"></script>
		<title>Html page</title>
	</head>

	<body>

	<a data-edc-id="score-chantdusoleil" class="countdownload" href="download/chant-soleil-2014-09-27-sample.pdf">Download the score "Chant du soleil"</a>
	<br />
	<a data-edc-id="score-nora" class="countdownload" href="download/chant-soleil-2014-09-27-sample.pdf">Download the score "Nora"</a>


	<script>
		(function ($) {


			$.fn.easyDownloadCounter.settings.serviceUrl = 'service/edc-service.php';
			$(document).ready(function () {
				$('.countdownload').easyDownloadCounter();
			});


		})(jQuery);

	</script>


	</body>
	</html>



You will then see two links; they are download links.
At the javascript level, the following line is important:

	$.fn.easyDownloadCounter.settings.serviceUrl = 'service/edc-service.php';

This line indicates the location of the main edc service to the jquery plugin.
This service is responsible for updating the statistics in your filesystem.
If you run your own website, you will probably want to update this value.


We can also add counters to show the number of downloads, like in the following example:


	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8"/>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"></script>
		<script src="easy-download-counter.js"></script>
		<title>Html page</title>
	</head>

	<body>

	<a data-edc-id="score-chantdusoleil" class="countdownload" href="download/chant-soleil-2014-09-27-sample.pdf">Download the score "Chant du soleil"</a>
	Downloads: <span data-edc-counter="score-chantdusoleil"></span>
	<br />

	<a data-edc-id="score-nora" class="countdownload" href="download/chant-soleil-2014-09-27-sample.pdf">Download the score "Nora"</a>
	Downloads: <span data-edc-counter="score-nora"></span>

	<script>
		(function ($) {


			$.fn.easyDownloadCounter.settings.serviceUrl = 'service/edc-service.php';
			$(document).ready(function () {
				$('.countdownload').easyDownloadCounter();
			});


		})(jQuery);

	</script>


	</body>
	</html>


The most important thing to take care of is that the value of the data-edc-counter attribute (of the counter)
is exactly the same as the value of the data-edc-id attribute (of the link).





Statistics visualization
------------------------------
To visualize the statistics, open the visualizer/visualizer.php page.
It will open a simple graphical user interface where you can have an overview of the downloaded links.





To update the counter values manually
---------------------------------------------
Aha, so you want to cheat?
Ok, all the stats are located in the service/stats folder.

Then, it depends on what exactly you want to modify.
The data used by the counters, and the data collected upon a clic are not located at the same location,
that's because of technical speed optimization reasons.

If you want to update the data displayed by the counters, and if abc is the identifier of your link,
then you want to update the value in the service/stats/abc.txt file.

On the other hand, if you want to update the data displayed by the statistics visualization interface,
you want to update the data located in the service/stats/abc folder.


Oh, and if you ever want to reset all the stats at once, you can simple remove the content of the stats folder
(if you are not sure of what you're doing, just consider making a copy of that folder before you do so),
it will be recreated automatically by the system.




The jQuery plugin: how it works in details
----------------
When the plugin is applied to a link, it will detect the pression of the left mouse button on that link.

You will set a special data-edc-id attribute on the link, which represents the link identifier.
This identifier is used to distinguish which link has been clicked when collecting or visualizing the data
in/from the filesystem.

It is also possible to create a counter for any link.
A counter is any html element with the data-edc-counter attribute on it, and the value of this attribute
has to be exactly the same as the value of the data-edc-id attribute of the link to which the counter is related.

For instance, the following code create a link and a related counter, and the identifier is score-chantdusoleil:

	<a data-edc-id="score-chantdusoleil" href="/link/to/chantdusoleil.pdf">Download the score</a>
	<br>
	Downloaded: <span data-edc-counter="score-chantdusoleil"></span>


The counter value is automatically updated when the page starts loading, and also when the user clicks a (edc) link.

The link type doesn't matter, we can use a download link or a regular link if we want.
For instance if we want to track the number of links for a regular link, we can use the following code:

	<a data-edc-id="website-partner-example" href="http://www.example.com">Go to the example site</a>

We could also put a counter on this link, but in this example, the link is a tracker and the user shouldn't be aware of the number
of clicks on it.



One last word
------------------
So that's it, I hope this plugin will save you some time.
Be sure to ask any questions that makes sense to you, if it's not clear in the doc, I will try my best to answer.


Have fun!
